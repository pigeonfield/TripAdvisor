# README

Simple App inspired by TripAdvisor written in Ruby on Rails. 
It contains photos and short descriptions, so it helps to organize trip destinations. And for sign-in users - add comments and ratings. 

Some of gems I used: 
paperclip - for uploading images
devise - user authentication
simple-form - all of forms
